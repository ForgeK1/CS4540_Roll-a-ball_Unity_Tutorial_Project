Before you begin to create your game, you need to set up your workspace and create a new scene.

In the top right of the Unity window, you will find a dropdown menu labeled Layout. 

A layout is a collection of stored positions of the tabs in Unity.

These tutorials use the default layout so it's easier for you to follow along, but you can change and save layouts you enjoy by using this menu.

These are saved in the Unity Editor settings so you can store and use them for different projects.

Now you've set a layout, you're ready to create a new scene.

Scenes are ways to organize the things in your game. You can think of them as different levels.

To create a new scene in the Unity editor, in the top menu, go to File, New Scene.

You will be presented with four template choices... Basic URP, Standard URP, Empty, and Basic Built In.

The Basic URP template contains a camera and direct light that acts as a sun. 

The Standard URP template contains the same, but includes a preset selection of post-processing effects and a global post-processing volume.

The Empty template is exactly that... empty. It contains no game objects or effects and gives you a blank slate to start from.

Finally, the Basic template is set up to work with the legacy built-in renderer. 

For this tutorial, select the Basic URP template and then select Create.

Next, save the scene by going back to File, Save As.

Now save your scene into the new folder called Scenes. Let's call the scene, Minigame.

In the Project window, you can now see the Scenes folder, and inside that, the scene called Minigame.

Now that you've set up your scene, in the next video you'll start creating the play area for your game.
