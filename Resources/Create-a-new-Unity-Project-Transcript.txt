Hello.


OK, first things first. In this video, you'll learn how to create a new Unity project. Let's get started.


First, open your Unity hub. 


Select the account icon and log in with your Unity account. If it shows your initials, you're already logged in.


Select projects and then new to open the new project window. 


At this point, you can choose from a range of different templates for your Unity project.


Select the 3D Universal template for this Unity project. 


The Universal Render Pipeline or URP lets you quickly and easily create optimized graphics across a range of platforms from mobile to high end consoles and PCs. 


If this is the first time you open a project with this template, you need to download the template first by selecting the download button to the right.


In the project name field, call this project Rollerball.


Next, in the location field, select the destination or file path for the new project.


Finally, select create project to make your project. It will open in the Unity editor.


Don't worry if this takes a little time to load, especially if this is the first time you've opened a project in the editor. 


Now that you've created the Unity project for your game, in the next video, you'll set up the workspace in the editor.
